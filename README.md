# WEB102 Prework - *Name of App Here*

Submitted by: **Moez Ullah Khan**

**Sea Monster Crowdfunding Dashboard** is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: **11** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [ ] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [ ] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [ ] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] A glowing border effect has been added to all buttons, highlighting the button currently being hovered over to improve visibility.

* [ ] An interactive and dynamic glowing animation has been applied to the background of all buttons, enhancing the user experience with a visually appealing effect.

* [ ] A hover-activated counter animation has been implemented for the statistics cards. When a user hovers over a statistics card, the displayed value animates from 0 to the actual statistic, providing an engaging and interactive experience.


* [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

* [ ] A feature that scales up the game card and blurs the background when a user clicks on a game card, allowing the user to focus on the game details without distractions.

* [ ] A theme-switching feature that allows users to toggle between a light theme and a dark theme, making the website easier to view at night.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

* Most of the significant challenges I faced was while implementing the optional features. 

* The hover-activated counter animations for the stats cards required precise timing and event handling. I consulted multiple online resources to ensure the animation triggered correctly without affecting other interactions.

* Initially tried to implement the counter animation with CSS, but switched to JavaScript after realizing the limitations, with the help of online tutorials.
